# Random_error_quantification_in_ML
We build a simple model using the cruise_ship_info.csv data set for predicting a ship's crew size. We show that the R2 score metric used for evaluating the model is random variable. Using k-fold cross-validation together with the random_state parameter used for partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets, we were able to quantify the random fluctuations of the R2 score.
